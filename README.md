*Hello!*
This game is aimed at the speed of your **reaction**.
The playing field has a **red square** in the center and **4 blue rectangles** in the corners.
You play **by mouse** as red square.
Blue squares start moving in a random direction and hit walls and bounce(over time they speed up).
You must **avoid them** for **as long as possible**.
If you go out of the playing field - you lost.
It sounds easy, but try to hold out for at least **15 seconds**.
(Press **ESC** to go to the **menu**.)


**How to play?**
IN TERMINAL:
pip3 install pygame
python3 main.py

**For MacOs**
If you get  error with pygame when you launch game, try do [this](https://ru.stackoverflow.com/questions/451879/%D0%9D%D0%B5-%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%83%D1%87%D0%B0%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%81%D1%8F-%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8C-%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%B4%D1%83%D0%BB%D1%8C-pygame-mac-os)
