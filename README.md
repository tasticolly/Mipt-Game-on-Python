# Mipt-Game-on-Python
*Hello!*
This game is aimed at the speed of your **reaction**.
The playing field has a **red square** in the center and **4 blue rectangles** in the corners.
You play **by mouse** as red square.
Blue squares start moving in a random direction and hit walls and bounce(over time they speed up).
You must **avoid them** for **as long as possible**.
If you go out of the playing field - you lost.
It sounds easy, but try to hold out for at least **15 seconds**.


**How to play?**
IN TERMINAL:
pip3 install pygame
python3 game.py

**For MacOs**
