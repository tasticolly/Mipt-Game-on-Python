# Mipt-Game-on-Python
Hello!
This game is aimed at the speed of your reaction.
The playing field has a red square in the center and 4 blue rectangles in the corners.
You play by mouse as red square.
Blue squares start moving in a random direction and hit walls and bounce(over time they speed up).
You must avoid them for as long as possible.
If you go out of the playing field - you lost.
It sounds easy, but try to hold out for at least 15 seconds.


How to play?
IN TERMINAL:
pip install pygame
python3 game.py

Good Luck!
